//! Foundation for loading our plugin loader into a TF2 dedicated server as
//! a Valve Server Plugin (VSP) - the same, Valve-documented mechanism
//! Metamod:Source itself uses to get loaded, rather than substituting or
//! LD_PRELOAD-wrapping server.so/engine.so.
//!
//! Engine-side indices and version strings come from exactly one place:
//! codegen_generated/engine_indexes.zig. That file is committed by hand;
//! its producer, build/EngineIndexesGenerator.zig, is not wired into the
//! build yet. Nothing in this file hand-maintains an index or a version
//! string of its own.
//!
//! Engine version handling in `load` no longer needs the removed
//! src/analyzers/EngineVersions.zig: the engine server interface is
//! probed directly against the version strings the codegen module knows
//! (see engine_interface_versions), and the version check in load()
//! refuses every build whose answered string does not equal the one the
//! codegen indices were generated for. That leaves the version probe
//! reduced to "which string answered" - the part the removed module used
//! to own.
//!
//! *** VERIFY BEFORE USE ***
//! The IServerPluginCallbacks method list below follows the Valve
//! Developer Wiki (https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/IServerPluginCallbacks)
//! and the historical public/engine/iserverplugin.h header. The first
//! nine methods (Load through LevelShutdown) have been stable across
//! every version of this interface I could find and are implemented for
//! real. Everything after that - the client/command callbacks added in
//! later interface versions (ClientConnect, ClientCommand,
//! NetworkIDValidated, OnQueryCvarValueFinished, OnEdictAllocated/Freed,
//! ...) - is backed by `genericStub`, a placeholder that safely ignores
//! whatever arguments it's called with and returns 0 (== false ==
//! PLUGIN_CONTINUE == null, a safe default for all of them).
//!
//! This padding exists so that if your exact TF2 build's interface has a
//! few more trailing methods than the nine implemented here, the engine
//! calling into one of them lands on a harmless no-op instead of jumping
//! into unmapped memory. It is NOT a substitute for implementing the
//! callbacks you actually want to act on - look up their real position
//! in your hl2sdk-tf2 checkout (public/engine/iserverplugin.h) and
//! replace the matching stub slot. `stub_count` is a guess at "more than
//! enough"; too large is harmless (an unindexed stub is simply never
//! called), but too *small* for your build's real interface means a call
//! past the end of the array - a crash. When in doubt, raise it.
//!
//! `plugin_interface_versions` - the versions of *our own*
//! IServerPluginCallbacks *we* claim to implement - is a separate concern
//! from engine-side detection: a wrong entry there just means
//! CreateInterface returns null for it and the engine tries the next one
//! (or logs an error and moves on) - it can't crash anything the way a
//! wrong engine-side vtable index can, so it doesn't need the same
//! verified-match treatment, even though it now comes from the codegen
//! too (consistency, not safety).
//!
//! Build with `zig build`: the result is zig-out/lib/zorcerer.so, built
//! for the x86_64-linux-gnu target configured in build.zig. Drop the .so
//! at `<mod>/addons/<name>.so` alongside a matching .vdf, e.g.
//! `tf/addons/zorcerer.so` + `tf/addons/zorcerer.vdf`. For fast iteration
//! without restarting the server, the engine also supports
//! loading/unloading a VSP interactively from the server console:
//! `plugin_load addons/zorcerer` / `plugin_unload <index>` (index shown
//! by `plugin_print`) - no .vdf needed while testing. Note `plugin_load`
//! only works before a map is running (see the console-command discussion
//! earlier) - the .vdf route is what actually loads this on a live server.
